Users, see the **[main web site](http://dngrep.github.io/)** to download and install dnGrep.

Here is the source code for dnGrep, a great Windows search utility that allows you to search across text files, Word documents, PDFs, and archives using text, regular expression, XPath, and phonetic queries.

Developers, see the [development documentation](https://github.com/dnGrep/dnGrep/wiki/Developer-Documentation) for info, including about the continuous build and release process.
